        		<h1>Hi there, I'm George</h1>
				<p>I have eight years experience using Ruby and more recently Go to deliver commercial projects in a variety of industries, often using a test driven approach. I’ve lead teams building high throughput transactional software and worked with legacy platforms to understand, debug and replicate complex systems. Many of the projects I’ve worked on have involved real time data processing and display. I have designed and deployed infrastructure to dedicated hardware, Amazon Web Services as well as platforms like Heroku. I enjoy working in collaborative team environments as well as delivering projects on a individual basis.</p>
